# Soft-Matter-Notes
This is a repository containing notes and projects of the course Soft Condensed Matter Physics that I offered in  August to December 2024 at Azim Premji University, Bangalore
## Course Syllabus
The course gives an overview of different aspects of soft condensed matter systems such as Colloids, Surfactants, Polymers and Liquid crystals. 
### Course description
The course builds on an introductory level knowledge of thermodynamics and statistical physics and the ideas of free energy, entropy and phase behaviour of multicomponent systems. The relevant energy and length scales for soft matter systems and the theory of elasticity and fluid mechanics are introduced briefly wherever relevant. A large class of materials encountered in everyday life such as colloids, surfactants, polymers, surfactants, foams, granular media, gels, monolayers and living matter at different length scales can be classified under soft matter. In this course we restrict ourselves to the first four and examine the physical principles governing the phase behaviour and dynamics of these systems. 

#### COLLOIDS

Colloids are particles with length scales less than 10 $\mu$ m. We begin with the Brownian motion of a single colloidal particle. Following a gentle introduction to Random Walks and Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem, we discuss the  interactions between two colloidal particles. Beginning with electrostatic interactions between molecules we use simple rules of additivity to study the attractive and repulsive forces between macroscopic bodies. Vander waals attraction between macroscopic objects of different geometry (infinite planes, cylinders and spheres), double layer repulsion between surfaces in the presence of an intervening medium, depletion forces and steric repulsion are discussed. These attractive and repulsive forces have a crucial role in stabilizing dispersion of colloidal particles in aqueous or organic solvents.

 An increase in the concentration of colloidal particles in dispersions, they may flocculate or arrange in closely packed arrays to form three dimensional crystals. We will conclude this unit by examining briefly the phase behaviour of hard sphere colloidal crystals stabilized through a delicate balance of hard sphere repulsive forces and the attractive depletion forces.

#### SURFACTANTS
The propensity of soft matter systems to self-assemble gives rise to a plethora of complex, ordered structures. We study here the self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules where one part of the molecule has affinity to water and the other part repels water.

We begin by considering a regular solution model based on a mean field theory to predict the free energy of mixing of two liquids by considering the interaction and entropy of mixing of two distinct molecules A and B in a 2D or 3D lattice. The free energy can be plotted for different strength of the interaction parameter $\chi$.
